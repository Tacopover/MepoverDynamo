# MepoverDynamo
A place to store all Mepover custom nodes and scripts

## Custom nodes
The custom nodes are the nodes that are available in the Mepover package that can be downloaded and installed from the Dynamo package manager.

## Scripts
The scripts folder has a bunch of scripts that I at one point made for some project. So there is no guarantee that they will run on your project, but I tried to only include scripts that are reasonably generic and can be easily modified to fit your own needs. Mostly they are scripts with some python nodes that I feel are worth sharing, but did not end up as a custom node.
